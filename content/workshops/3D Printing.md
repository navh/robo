# Goal

To design and build/print a thingamajig for the Robo Club

The parts that have been made so far are stored in [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p3KEBeuUeoSDM_l_yLE4DOLT9fUCriH5)

## What?

The workshop will be based around engineering design of a part (to be determined).

Part one of the workshop will be a discussion/brainstorm session of what we are trying to build, determining specs/requirements and considerations for the design. Part two of the workshop will be a quick introduction to the 3D-printing toolchain and discussion of the use of 3D printing in engineering designs.

Finally, part three of the workshop will be a hands-on practical where we will actually model the part in CAD and produce the files required to print the part! Captain Marasco conduct a tutorial/walkthrough of OpenSCAD, although if you want to use a different program, feel free!

## When?

19:00 on Janurary 28th and 29th

## Where?

Sawyer 5206

## What will I need?

Nothing, but if you prefer to use your own laptop, download/install [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html) and bring that.

Although our tutorial will be based around OpenSCAD, if you are already comfortable with SolidWorks you may go ahead and use that instead!
