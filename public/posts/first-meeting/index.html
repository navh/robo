  <h1>First Meeting</h1>

<h2 id="starting-out">Starting Out</h2>

<p>Quick presentation about where we might be able to take the club.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>What did those present want to do with the club?</p>

<h3 id="not-a-kit">Not a kit</h3>

<p>It was obvious that folks were more interested in following through the complete design process than simply putting together their own small robot.</p>

<p>Although initially we will not have the resourses or comitment to tackle something as huge as a self driving car or small spacecraft, we plan to create a couple of smaller robots in teams.</p>

<h3 id="timing">Timing</h3>

<p>Starting any new club is always difficult, trying to work around existing comitments and constraints put on us by the college requires a little bit of compromise.</p>

<p>The biggest hurdle seemed to be IMs, given the new rotation that has them happening on Mondays and Wednesdays. To overcome this we have decided to have meetings on both Mondays and Tuesdays that will largely be repeats of one another so that as many folks as possible can come out.</p>

<h3 id="internal-competition">Internal Competition</h3>

<p>After the meeting we have decided that hosting some sort of internal competition will be the fastest way to get actually building something so that hopefully by the end of this year we will be able to see what we are capable of!</p>
