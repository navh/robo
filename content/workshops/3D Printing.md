Captain Marasco will walk everybody through a simple example of CAD and at the end files will be submitted to be actually printed!

## When?

19:00 on Janurary 28th and 29th

## Where?

Massey 7 perhaps?

## What will I need?

Your own laptop with [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html) installed on it and an idea for what kind of shape you'd like to make. 

Although our tutorial will be based around OpenSCAD, if you are already comfortable with SolidWorks you may go ahead and use that instead!
