      <description>Starting Out Quick presentation about where we might be able to take the club.
Discussion What did those present want to do with the club?
Not a kit It was obvious that folks were more interested in following through the complete design process than simply putting together their own small robot.
Although initially we will not have the resourses or comitment to tackle something as huge as a self driving car or small spacecraft, we plan to create a couple of smaller robots in teams.</description>
