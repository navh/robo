      <description>Goal To design and build/print a thingamajig for the Robo Club
The parts that have been made so far are stored in this folder
What? The workshop will be based around engineering design of a part (to be determined).
Part one of the workshop will be a discussion/brainstorm session of what we are trying to build, determining specs/requirements and considerations for the design. Part two of the workshop will be a quick introduction to the 3D-printing toolchain and discussion of the use of 3D printing in engineering designs.</description>
