## Monday

Only a few people showed up who were already quite familiar with SolidWorks so we got to daydreaming about what sorts of things we could print.

Eventually we decided that we would attempt to create a type of logo for the club in 3 dimensions.

The logo will be a robotic version of the RMC logo, with rectangular jointed bits, a claw with grabbies, and a USB Trident sticking out of the top.

Along the bottom of the RMC logo is something we have started calling the *churro*. This is the twisted bands underneath the arm. Creating a 3D version of this has proven to be quite an interesting task.

## Tuesday

More people showed up, and this time we ran an OpenSCAD tutorial very quickly and then delegated out parts based on initial comfort with the OpenSCAD scripting language. Some parts were put into [a folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p3KEBeuUeoSDM_l_yLE4DOLT9fUCriH5) to eventually be 3D printed. 

There is still more work to happen, but hopefully some of the more keen beans will get this done on their own time so that we can get printing!
